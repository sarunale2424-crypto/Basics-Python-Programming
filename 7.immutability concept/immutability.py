# Immutability: ulchangability
#fundamentals types: int, float, complex, bool, str => all fundamentals data types in python are immutable

# x = 100
# print(id(x))
# x = 200
# print(id(x))


#fundamental data types vs immutability:
#once we create an object we are not allowed to perform any changes on that object. If we are trying to perform the change , with those change new object is created, This things is considered as immutability.

# a = 50
# b = 50
# c = 50

# suppose : location(Kathmandu) : population(name,fathername,numberof son : varry,location:kathmandu)
